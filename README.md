👋 Hi, I’m Samuel (@skwits-dev) <br>
👀 I’m interested in software engineering and all things music + philosophy <br>
🌱 I’m currently focused on building things using JavaScript (MERN Stack) + TypeScript, as well as Go <br>
🥖 I have taken multiple courses focused entirely on problem solving in Java & C++ <br>
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on intriguing projects -- feel free to reach out <br>
🍻 Cheers!
