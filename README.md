👋 Hi, I’m Sam (@skwits-dev) <br>
👀 I’m interested in software engineering and all things music + philosophy <br>
🌱 I’m currently focused on building things using JavaScript + TypeScript (MERN Stack), as well as Go. I also have general knowledge in Java & C++ <br>
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on intriguing projects -- feel free to reach out <br>
🍻 Cheers!
